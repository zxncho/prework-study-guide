# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

The goal was to create a study guide that can be used for the duration of the coding bootcamp. This guide allows for notes to be taken as you apply your skills in a live environment. The key factor is interactivity for this document. During this project I learned how to apply HTML,CSS and JavaScript to any webpage that I make. I also learned the principles of using Git and Github for version control.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?


If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

N/A

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

As learnings mount during the coding bootcamp course then this webpage can be used as a study guide for all learnings. There is the visible portion of the study guide on the webpage itself but also more tips and tricks that show up in each created branch and the console on the browser. Notes are to be added in the index.html file for each subject. There is also the ability to create notes on each asset file that wont be visible in the website but able to be referred to in Visual Studio Code.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.



## Credits

N/A

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

Please refer to the LICENSE in the repository.

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
