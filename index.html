          <li>CSS allows you to add stylistics to your website 
            <li>CSS uses properties to establish syle specs of the website</li> 
          <li>CSS sets properties using values already programmed into your computer</li>
          <li>margins decide how much blank space you want in your websites appearance</li>
          <li>Padding decides the heaviness of a photo in your website. this makes the picture bigger</li>
          <li>its best to use commas with similar properties to keep from doing double work</li>
          <li>to commit properties to the entire webpage, you simply use the * in front of your selector</li>
          <li>the {} characters are used to open and close the selector</li>
          <li>link element allows you to link to an external file. Especially important because
            using external CSS files is recommended. It is recommended because of the ease in which you
            can add the styles into the main branch but also for purposes of debugging ease.
